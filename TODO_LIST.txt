6. Refact the mechanism of InstanceSpace bind object.(For instance: HttpServletRequest bind in request InstanceSpace, ServletContext bind in container InstanceSpace)
   New way: Bind the object in special path of InstanceSpace. 
      For example:  HttpServletRequest bind in "/request" path at request lifecycle scope.
                    "/request/attibuteName" could directory access the request attribute by name.
                    HttpSession bind in "/session" path at "request" lifecycle scope.
					ServletContext bind in "/application" path at "container" lifecycle scope.

   和JSP EL表达式类似：
   "/request"
   "/request/attibuteName"
   "/param/paramName"
   "/paramValues/paramName" 返回数组值
   "/session"
   "/session/attibuteName"
